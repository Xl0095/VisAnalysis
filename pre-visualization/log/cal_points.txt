[2023-03-13 14:24:27]sentences:flow-based scatterplots for sensitivity analysis.visualization of multi-dimensional data is challenging due to the number of complex correlations that may be present in the data but that are difficult to be visually identified. one of the main causes for this problem is the inherent loss of information that occurs when high-dimensional data is projected into 2d or 3d. although 2d scatterplots are ubiquitous due to their simplicity and familiarity, there are not a lot of variations on their basic metaphor. in this paper, we present a new way of visualizing multidimensional data using scatterplots. we extend 2d scatterplots using sensitivity coefficients to highlight local variation of one variable with respect to another. when applied to a scatterplot, these sensitivities can be understood as velocities, and the resulting visualization resembles a flow field. we also present a number of operations, based on flow-field analysis, that help users navigate, select and cluster points in an efficient manner. we show the flexibility and generality of this approach using a number of multidimensional data sets across different domains..uncertainty.data transformations.principal component analysis.model fitting

[2023-03-13 14:24:27]sentences:how locus of control influences compatibility with visualization style.existing research suggests that individual personality differences are correlated with a user's speed and accuracy in solving problems with different types of complex visualization systems. in this paper, we extend this research by isolating factors in personality traits as well as in the visualizations that could have contributed to the observed correlation. we focus on a personality trait known as “locus of control,” which represents a person's tendency to see themselves as controlled by or in control of external events. to isolate variables of the visualization design, we control extraneous factors such as color, interaction, and labeling, and specifically focus on the overall layout style of the visualizations. we conduct a user study with four visualizations that gradually shift from an indentation metaphor to a containment metaphor and compare the participants' speed, accuracy, and preference with their locus of control. our findings demonstrate that there is indeed a correlation between the two: participants with an internal locus of control perform more poorly with visualizations that employ a containment metaphor, while those with an external locus of control perform well with such visualizations. we discuss a possible explanation for this relationship based in cognitive psychology and propose that these results can be used to better understand how people use visualizations and how to adapt visual analytics design to an individual user's needs..

[2023-03-13 14:24:27]sentences:multidimensional data dissection using attribute relationship graphs.visual exploration and analysis is a process of discovering and dissecting the abundant and complex attribute relationships that pervade multidimensional data. recent research has identified and characterized patterns of multiple coordinated views, such as cross-filtered views, in which rapid sequences of simple interactions can be used to express queries on subsets of attribute values. in visualizations designed around these patterns, for the most part, distinct views serve to visually isolate each attribute from the others. although the brush-and-click simplicity of visual isolation facilitates discovery of many-to-many relationships between attributes, dissecting these relationships into more fine-grained one-to-many relationships is interactively tedious and, worse, visually fragmented over prolonged sequences of queries. this paper describes: (1) a method for interactively dissecting multidimensional data by iteratively slicing and manipulating a multigraph representation of data values and value co-occurrences; and (2) design strategies for extending the construction of coordinated multiple view interfaces for dissection as well as discovery of attribute relationships in multidimensional data sets. using examples from different domains, we describe how attribute relationship graphs can be combined with cross-filtered views, modularized for reuse across designs, and integrated into broader visual analysis tools. the exploratory and analytic utility of these examples suggests that an attribute relationship graph would be a useful addition to a wide variety of visual analysis tools..d.2.2 [software engineering]: design tools and techniques-[user interfaces].h.2.3 [information systems]: database management-[languages].h.5.2 [information systems]: information interfaces and presentation-[user interfaces]

[2023-03-13 14:24:27]sentences:finding waldo: learning about users from their interactions.visual analytics is inherently a collaboration between human and computer. however, in current visual analytics systems, the computer has limited means of knowing about its users and their analysis processes. while existing research has shown that a user's interactions with a system reflect a large amount of the user's reasoning process, there has been limited advancement in developing automated, real-time techniques that mine interactions to learn about the user. in this paper, we demonstrate that we can accurately predict a user's task performance and infer some user personality traits by using machine learning techniques to analyze interaction data. specifically, we conduct an experiment in which participants perform a visual search task, and apply well-known machine learning algorithms to three encodings of the users' interaction data. we achieve, depending on algorithm and encoding, between 62% and 83% accuracy at predicting whether each user will be fast or slow at completing the task. beyond predicting performance, we demonstrate that using the same techniques, we can infer aspects of the user's personality factors, including locus of control, extraversion, and neuroticism. further analyses show that strong results can be attained with limited observation time: in one case 95% of the final accuracy is gained after a quarter of the average task completion time. overall, our findings show that interactions can provide information to the computer about its human collaborator, and establish a foundation for realizing mixed-initiative visual analytics systems..adolescent.adult.algorithms.computer graphics.decision making.humans.image processing.computer-assisted.machine learning.middle aged.personality.task performance and analysis.user-computer interface.young adult

[2023-03-13 14:24:28]sentences:familiarity vs trust: a comparative study of domain scientists' trust in visual analytics and conventional analysis methods.combining interactive visualization with automated analytical methods like statistics and data mining facilitates data-driven discovery. these visual analytic methods are beginning to be instantiated within mixed-initiative systems, where humans and machines collaboratively influence evidence-gathering and decision-making. but an open research question is that, when domain experts analyze their data, can they completely trust the outputs and operations on the machine-side? visualization potentially leads to a transparent analysis process, but do domain experts always trust what they see? to address these questions, we present results from the design and evaluation of a mixed-initiative, visual analytics system for biologists, focusing on analyzing the relationships between familiarity of an analysis medium and domain experts' trust. we propose a trust-augmented design of the visual analytics system, that explicitly takes into account domain-specific tasks, conventions, and preferences. for evaluating the system, we present the results of a controlled user study with 34 biologists where we compare the variation of the level of trust across conventional and visual analytic mediums and explore the influence of familiarity and task complexity on trust. we find that despite being unfamiliar with a visual analytic medium, scientists seem to have an average level of trust that is comparable with the same in conventional analysis medium. in fact, for complex sense-making tasks, we find that the visual analytic system is able to inspire greater trust than other mediums. we summarize the implications of our findings with directions for future research on trustworthiness of visual analytic systems..trust.transparency.familiarity.uncertainty.biological data analysis

[2023-03-13 14:24:28]sentences:paralleltopics: a probabilistic approach to exploring document collections.scalable and effective analysis of large text corpora remains a challenging problem as our ability to collect textual data continues to increase at an exponential rate. to help users make sense of large text corpora, we present a novel visual analytics system, parallel-topics, which integrates a state-of-the-art probabilistic topic model latent dirichlet allocation (lda) with interactive visualization. to describe a corpus of documents, paralleltopics first extracts a set of semantically meaningful topics using lda. unlike most traditional clustering techniques in which a document is assigned to a specific cluster, the lda model accounts for different topical aspects of each individual document. this permits effective full text analysis of larger documents that may contain multiple topics. to highlight this property of the model, paralleltopics utilizes the parallel coordinate metaphor to present the probabilistic distribution of a document across topics. such representation allows the users to discover single-topic vs. multi-topic documents and the relative importance of each topic to a document of interest. in addition, since most text corpora are inherently temporal, paralleltopics also depicts the topic evolution over time. we have applied paralleltopics to exploring and analyzing several text corpora, including the scientific proposals awarded by the national science foundation and the publications in the vast community over the years. to demonstrate the efficacy of paralleltopics, we conducted several expert evaluations, the results of which are reported in this paper..

[2023-03-13 14:24:29]sentences:interactive visual comparison of multiple trees.traditionally, the visual analysis of hierarchies, respectively, trees, is conducted by focusing on one given hierarchy. however, in many research areas multiple, differing hierarchies need to be analyzed simultaneously in a comparative way - in particular to highlight differences between them, which sometimes can be subtle. a prominent example is the analysis of so-called phylogenetic trees in biology, reflecting hierarchical evolutionary relationships among a set of organisms. typically, the analysis considers multiple phylogenetic trees, either to account for statistical significance or for differences in derivation of such evolutionary hierarchies; for example, based on different input data, such as the 16s ribosomal rna and protein sequences of highly conserved enzymes. the simultaneous analysis of a collection of such trees leads to more insight into the evolutionary process. we introduce a novel visual analytics approach for the comparison of multiple hierarchies focusing on both global and local structures. a new tree comparison score has been elaborated for the identification of interesting patterns. we developed a set of linked hierarchy views showing the results of automatic tree comparison on various levels of details. this combined approach offers detailed assessment of local and global tree similarities. the approach was developed in close cooperation with experts from the evolutionary biology domain. we apply it to a phylogenetic data set on bacterial ancestry, demonstrating its application benefit..[h.5.2]: user interfaces (d.2.2.h.1.2.i.3.6)—interaction styles (e.g..commands.menus.forms.direct manipulation).i.3.6 [computer graphics]: methodology and techniques—graphics data structures and data types

[2023-03-13 14:24:30]sentences:a visual analytics approach to model learning.the process of learning models from raw data typically requires a substantial amount of user input during the model initialization phase. we present an assistive visualization system which greatly reduces the load on the users and makes the process of model initialization and refinement more efficient, problem-driven, and engaging. utilizing a sequence segmentation task with a hidden markov model as an example, we assign each token in the sequence a feature vector based on its various properties within the sequence. these vectors are then clustered according to similarity, generating a layout of the individual tokens in form of a node link diagram where the length of the links is determined by the feature vector similarity. users may then tune the weights of the feature vector components to improve the segmentation, which is visualized as a better separation of the clusters. also, as individual clusters represent different classes, the user can now work at the cluster level to define token classes, instead of labelling one entry at time. inconsistent entries visually identify themselves by locating at the periphery of clusters, and the user then helps refine the model by resolving these inconsistencies. our system therefore makes efficient use of the knowledge of its users, only requesting user assistance for non-trivial data items. it so allows users to visually analyse data at a higher, more abstract level, improving scalability..visual knowledge discovery.visual knowledge representation.data clustering.human-computer interaction

[2023-03-13 14:24:30]sentences:visual analytics for model selection in time series analysis.model selection in time series analysis is a challenging task for domain experts in many application areas such as epidemiology, economy, or environmental sciences. the methodology used for this task demands a close combination of human judgement and automated computation. however, statistical software tools do not adequately support this combination through interactive visual interfaces. we propose a visual analytics process to guide domain experts in this task. for this purpose, we developed the timova prototype that implements this process based on user stories and iterative expert feedback on user experience. the prototype was evaluated by usage scenarios with an example dataset from epidemiology and interviews with two external domain experts in statistics. the insights from the experts' feedback and the usage scenarios show that timova is able to support domain experts in model selection tasks through interactive visual interfaces with short feedback cycles..time series analysis.analytical models.autoregressive processes.mathematical model.data models.coordinated & multiple views.visual analytics.model selection.visual interaction.time series analysis

[2023-03-13 14:24:30]sentences:visual methods for analyzing probabilistic classification data.multi-class classifiers often compute scores for the classification samples describing probabilities to belong to different classes. in order to improve the performance of such classifiers, machine learning experts need to analyze classification results for a large number of labeled samples to find possible reasons for incorrect classification. confusion matrices are widely used for this purpose. however, they provide no information about classification scores and features computed for the samples. we propose a set of integrated visual methods for analyzing the performance of probabilistic classifiers. our methods provide insight into different aspects of the classification results for a large number of samples. one visualization emphasizes at which probabilities these samples were classified and how these probabilities correlate with classification error in terms of false positives and false negatives. another view emphasizes the features of these samples and ranks them by their separation power between selected true and false classifications. we demonstrate the insight gained using our technique in a benchmarking classification dataset, and show how it enables improving classification performance by interactively defining and evaluating post-classification rules..confusion analysis.feature evaluation and selection.visual inspection

[2023-03-13 14:24:30]sentences:visual analytics for complex engineering systems: hybrid visual steering of simulation ensembles.in this paper we propose a novel approach to hybrid visual steering of simulation ensembles. a simulation ensemble is a collection of simulation runs of the same simulation model using different sets of control parameters. complex engineering systems have very large parameter spaces so a naïve sampling can result in prohibitively large simulation ensembles. interactive steering of simulation ensembles provides the means to select relevant points in a multi-dimensional parameter space (design of experiment). interactive steering efficiently reduces the number of simulation runs needed by coupling simulation and visualization and allowing a user to request new simulations on the fly. as system complexity grows, a pure interactive solution is not always sufficient. the new approach of hybrid steering combines interactive visual steering with automatic optimization. hybrid steering allows a domain expert to interactively (in a visualization) select data points in an iterative manner, approximate the values in a continuous region of the simulation space (by regression) and automatically find the “best” points in this continuous region based on the specified constraints and objectives (by optimization). we argue that with the full spectrum of optimization options, the steering process can be improved substantially. we describe an integrated system consisting of a simulation, a visualization, and an optimization component. we also describe typical tasks and propose an interactive analysis workflow for complex engineering systems. we demonstrate our approach on a case study from automotive industry, the optimization of a hydraulic circuit in a high pressure common rail diesel injection system..integrated design environment.simulation.visual steering.automatic optimization

[2023-03-13 14:24:31]sentences:genotet: an interactive web-based visual exploration framework to support validation of gene regulatory networks.elucidation of transcriptional regulatory networks (trns) is a fundamental goal in biology, and one of the most important components of trns are transcription factors (tfs), proteins that specifically bind to gene promoter and enhancer regions to alter target gene expression patterns. advances in genomic technologies as well as advances in computational biology have led to multiple large regulatory network models (directed networks) each with a large corpus of supporting data and gene-annotation. there are multiple possible biological motivations for exploring large regulatory network models, including: validating tf-target gene relationships, figuring out co-regulation patterns, and exploring the coordination of cell processes in response to changes in cell state or environment. here we focus on queries aimed at validating regulatory network models, and on coordinating visualization of primary data and directed weighted gene regulatory networks. the large size of both the network models and the primary data can make such coordinated queries cumbersome with existing tools and, in particular, inhibits the sharing of results between collaborators. in this work, we develop and demonstrate a web-based framework for coordinating visualization and exploration of expression data (rna-seq, microarray), network models and gene-binding data (chip-seq). using specialized data structures and multiple coordinated views, we design an efficient querying model to support interactive analysis of the data. finally, we show the effectiveness of our framework through case studies for the mouse immune system (a dataset focused on a subset of key cellular functions) and a model bacteria (a small genome with high data-completeness)..animals.computational biology.computer graphics.databases.genetic.gene regulatory networks.internet.mice.transcription factors.user-computer interface

[2023-03-13 14:24:31]sentences:visually exploring transportation schedules.public transportation schedules are designed by agencies to optimize service quality under multiple constraints. however, real service usually deviates from the plan. therefore, transportation analysts need to identify, compare and explain both eventual and systemic performance issues that must be addressed so that better timetables can be created. the purely statistical tools commonly used by analysts pose many difficulties due to the large number of attributes at tripand station-level for planned and real service. also challenging is the need for models at multiple scales to search for patterns at different times and stations, since analysts do not know exactly where or when relevant patterns might emerge and need to compute statistical summaries for multiple attributes at different granularities. to aid in this analysis, we worked in close collaboration with a transportation expert to design tr-ex, a visual exploration tool developed to identify, inspect and compare spatio-temporal patterns for planned and real transportation service. tr-ex combines two new visual encodings inspired by marey's train schedule: trips explorer for trip-level analysis of frequency, deviation and speed; and stops explorer for station-level study of delay, wait time, reliability and performance deficiencies such as bunching. to tackle overplotting and to provide a robust representation for a large numbers of trips and stops at multiple scales, the system supports variable kernel bandwidths to achieve the level of detail required by users for different tasks. we justify our design decisions based on specific analysis needs of transportation analysts. we provide anecdotal evidence of the efficacy of tr-ex through a series of case studies that explore nyc subway service, which illustrate how tr-ex can be used to confirm hypotheses and derive new insights through visual exploration..transportation.schedules.kernel density estimation.visual exploration

[2023-03-13 14:24:32]sentences:visual causality analysis made practical.deriving the exact casual model that governs the relations between variables in a multidimensional dataset is difficult in practice. it is because causal inference algorithms by themselves typically cannot encode an adequate amount of domain knowledge to break all ties. visual analytic approaches are considered a feasible alternative to fully automated methods. however, their application in real-world scenarios can be tedious. this paper focuses on these practical aspects of visual causality analysis. the most imperative of these aspects is posed by simpson' paradox. it implies the existence of multiple causal models differing in both structure and parameter depending on how the data is subdivided. we propose a comprehensive interface that engages human experts in identifying these subdivisions and allowing them to establish the corresponding causal models via a rich set of interactive facilities. other features of our interface include: (1) a new causal network visualization that emphasizes the flow of causal dependencies, (2) a model scoring mechanism with visual hints for interactive model refinement, and (3) flexible approaches for handling heterogeneous data. various real-world data examples are given..visual knowledge discovery.causality.hypothesis testing.visual evidence.high-dimensional data

It frames the task of understanding and transforming input dimensions as a series of analysis steps where users transform data tables by chaining together different techniques, called operators, into pipelines of expressions.

Users interact with the operator controls to tune parameter choices, with immediate visual feedback guiding the exploration of local neighborhoods of the space of possible data tables. DimStiller also provides global guidance for navigating data-table space through expression templates called workflows, which permit re-use of common patterns of analysis.",0.0

In many domains not only the risk of a wrong decision, but in particular the trade-off between the costs of possible decisions are of utmost importance. In this paper we describe a framework tightly integrating interactive visual exploration with machine learning to support the decision making process. The proposed approach uses a series of interactive 2D visualizations of numeric and ordinal data combined with visualization of classification models. These series of visual elements are further linked to the classifier's performance visualized using an interactive performance curve. An interactive decision point on the performance curve allows the decision maker to steer the classification model and instantly identify the critical, cost changing data elements, in the various linked visualizations. The critical data elements are represented as images in order to trigger associations related to the knowledge of the expert. In this context the data visualization and classification results are not only linked together, but are also linked back to the classification model. Such a visual analytics framework allows the user to interactively explore the costs of his decisions for different settings of the model and accordingly use the most suitable classification model and make more informed and reliable decisions. A case study on data from the Forensic Psychiatry domain reveals the usefulness of the suggested approach.",0.0

Given high-dimensional data and associated cluster labels, LDA gives their reduced dimensional representation, which provides a good overview about the cluster structure. Instead of a single two- or three-dimensional scatter plot, iVisClassifier fully interacts with all the reduced dimensions obtained by LDA through parallel coordinates and a scatter plot. Furthermore, it significantly improves the interactivity and interpretability of LDA. LDA enables users to understand each of the reduced dimensions and how they influence the data by reconstructing the basis vector into the original data domain. By using heat maps, iVisClassifier gives an overview about the cluster relationship in terms of pairwise distances between cluster centroids both in the original space and in the reduced dimensional space. Equipped with these functionalities, iVisClassifier supports users' classification tasks in an efficient way. Using several facial image data, we show how the above analysis is performed.",0.0

Modern astronomical surveys provide not only image data but also catalogues of millions of objects (stars, galaxies), each object with hundreds of associated parameters. Exploration of this very high-dimensional data space poses a huge challenge. Subspace clustering is one among several approaches which have been proposed for this purpose in recent years. However, many clustering algorithms require the user to set a large number of parameters without any guidelines. Some methods also do not provide a concise summary of the datasets, or, if they do, they lack additional important information such as the number of clusters present or the significance of the clusters. In this paper, we propose a method for ranking subspaces for clustering which overcomes many of the above limitations. First we carry out a transformation from parametric space to discrete image space where the data are represented by a grid-based density field. Then we apply so-called connected morphological operators on this density field of astronomical objects that provides visual support for the analysis of the important subspaces. Clusters in subspaces correspond to high-intensity regions in the density image. The importance of a cluster is measured by a new quality criterion based on the dynamics of local maxima of the density. Connected operators are able to extract such regions with an indication of the number of clusters present. The subspaces are visualized during computation of the quality measure, so that the user can interact with the system to improve the results. In the result stage, we use three visualization toolkits linked within a graphical user interface so that the user can perform an in-depth exploration of the ranked subspaces. Evaluation based on synthetic as well as real astronomical datasets demonstrates the power of the new method. We recover various known astronomical relations directly from the data with little or no a pri...",1.0

We present an assistive visualization system which greatly reduces the load on the users and makes the process of model initialization and refinement more efficient, problem-driven, and engaging. Utilizing a sequence segmentation task with a Hidden Markov Model as an example, we assign each token in the sequence a feature vector based on its various properties within the sequence. These vectors are then clustered according to similarity, generating a layout of the individual tokens in form of a node link diagram where the length of the links is determined by the feature vector similarity. Users may then tune the weights of the feature vector components to improve the segmentation, which is visualized as a better separation of the clusters. Also, as individual clusters represent different classes, the user can now work at the cluster level to define token classes, instead of labelling one entry at time. Inconsistent entries visually identify themselves by locating at the periphery of clusters, and the user then helps refine the model by resolving these inconsistencies. Our system therefore makes efficient use of the knowledge of its users, only requesting user assistance for non-trivial data items. It so allows users to visually analyse data at a higher, more abstract level, improving scalability.",0.0

Analyzing such network with social attributes requires making sense of not only its structural features, but also the relationship between social features in attributes and network structures. Existing social network analysis tools are usually weak in supporting complex analytical tasks involving both structural and social features, and often overlook users' needs for sensemaking tools that help to gather, synthesize, and organize information of these features. To address these challenges, we propose a sensemaking framework of social-network visual analytics in this paper. This framework considers both bottom-up processes, which are about constructing new understandings based on collected information, and top-down processes, which concern using prior knowledge to guide information collection, in analyzing social networks from both social and structural perspectives. The framework also emphasizes the externalization of sensemaking processes through interactive visualization. Guided by the framework, we develop a system, SocialNetSense, to support the sensemaking in visual analytics of social networks with social attributes.

Our approach consists of providing analysts with various views of information related to moving objects in a video. To do this we first extract each object's movement path. We visualize each movement by (a) creating a single action shot image (a still image that coalesces multiple frames), (b) plotting its trajectory in a space-time cube and (c) displaying an overall timeline view of all the movements. The action shots provide a still view of the moving object while the path view presents movement properties such as speed and location. We also provide tools for spatial and temporal filtering based on regions of interest. This allows analysts to filter out large amounts of movement activities while the action shot representation summarizes the content of each movement. We incorporated this multi-part visual representation of moving objects in sViSIT, a tool to facilitate browsing through the video content by interactive querying and retrieval of data. Based on our interaction with security personnel who routinely interact with surveillance video data, we identified some of the most common tasks performed. This resulted in designing a user study to measure time-to-completion of the various tasks. These generally required searching for specific events of interest (targets) in videos. Fourteen different tasks were designed and a total of 120 min of surveillance video were recorded (indoor and outdoor locations recording movements of people and vehicles). The time-to-completion of these tasks were compared against a manual fast forward video browsing guided with movement detection. We demonstrate how our system can facilitate lengthy video exploration and significantly reduce browsing time to find events of interest. Reports from expert users identify positive aspects of our approach which we summarize in our recommendations for future video visual analytics systems.",1.0

However, most of the widely-used methods based on probabilistic modeling have drawbacks in terms of consistency from multiple runs and empirical convergence. Furthermore, due to the complicatedness in the formulation and the algorithm, LDA cannot easily incorporate various types of user feedback. To tackle this problem, we propose a reliable and flexible visual analytics system for topic modeling called UTOPIAN (User-driven Topic modeling based on Interactive Nonnegative Matrix Factorization). Centered around its semi-supervised formulation, UTOPIAN enables users to interact with the topic modeling method and steer the result in a user-driven manner.

A simulation ensemble is a collection of simulation runs of the same simulation model using different sets of control parameters. Complex engineering systems have very large parameter spaces so a naïve sampling can result in prohibitively large simulation ensembles. Interactive steering of simulation ensembles provides the means to select relevant points in a multi-dimensional parameter space (design of experiment). Interactive steering efficiently reduces the number of simulation runs needed by coupling simulation and visualization and allowing a user to request new simulations on the fly. As system complexity grows, a pure interactive solution is not always sufficient. The new approach of hybrid steering combines interactive visual steering with automatic optimization. Hybrid steering allows a domain expert to interactively (in a visualization) select data points in an iterative manner, approximate the values in a continuous region of the simulation space (by regression) and automatically find the “best” points in this continuous region based on the specified constraints and objectives (by optimization). We argue that with the full spectrum of optimization options, the steering process can be improved substantially. We describe an integrated system consisting of a simulation, a visualization, and an optimization component. We also describe typical tasks and propose an interactive analysis workflow for complex engineering systems.

However, real service usually deviates from the plan. Therefore, transportation analysts need to identify, compare and explain both eventual and systemic performance issues that must be addressed so that better timetables can be created. The purely statistical tools commonly used by analysts pose many difficulties due to the large number of attributes at tripand station-level for planned and real service. Also challenging is the need for models at multiple scales to search for patterns at different times and stations, since analysts do not know exactly where or when relevant patterns might emerge and need to compute statistical summaries for multiple attributes at different granularities. To aid in this analysis, we worked in close collaboration with a transportation expert to design TR-EX, a visual exploration tool developed to identify, inspect and compare spatio-temporal patterns for planned and real transportation service. TR-EX combines two new visual encodings inspired by Marey's Train Schedule: Trips Explorer for trip-level analysis of frequency, deviation and speed; and Stops Explorer for station-level study of delay, wait time, reliability and performance deficiencies such as bunching.

To answer seemingly simple questions such as “What were the taxi trips starting from Main Street and ending at Wall Street in the morning?” or “Where are the taxis arriving at the Art Museum at noon typically coming from?”, tedious and time consuming interactions are usually needed since the numeric GPS points of trajectories are not directly linked to the keywords such as “Main Street”, “Wall Street”, and “Art Museum”. In this paper, we present SemanticTraj, a new method for managing and visualizing taxi trajectory data in an intuitive, semantic rich, and efficient means. With SemanticTraj, domain and public users can find answers to the aforementioned questions easily through direct queries based on the terms. They can also interactively explore the retrieved data in visualizations enhanced by semantic information of the trajectories and trips. In particular, taxi trajectories are converted into taxi documents through a textualization transformation process.

In this paper, we leveraged the block information on the Region Of Interest (ROI) based brain networks and studied the problem of blockwise brain network visual comparison. An integrated visual analytics framework was proposed. In the first stage, a two-level ROI block hierarchy was detected by optimizing the anatomical structure and the predictive comparison performance simultaneously. In the second stage, the NodeTrix representation was adopted and customized to visualize the brain network with block information. We conducted controlled user experiments and case studies to evaluate our proposed solution.

The current work focuses on either building the skeleton of science, lacking interaction, detailed exploration and interpretation or on the lower topic level, missing high-level macro-perspective. To fill this gap, we design and implement Galaxy Evolution Explorer (Galex), a hierarchical visual analysis system, in combination with advanced text mining technologies, that could help analysts to comprehend the evolution and intersection of one discipline rapidly. We divide Galex into three progressively fine-grained levels: discipline, area, and institution levels. The combination of interactions enables analysts to explore an arbitrary piece of history and an arbitrary part of the knowledge space of one discipline. Using a flexible spotlight component, analysts could freely select and quickly understand an exploration region. A tree metaphor allows analysts to perceive the expansion, decline, and intersection of topics intuitively. A synchronous spotlight interaction aids in comparing research contents among institutions easily. Three cases demonstrate the effectiveness of our system.",1.0

In this paper, we present a novel approach to generate exploranative (explanatory and exploratory) data-driven documents that report code quality in an interactive, exploratory environment. We employ a template-based natural language generation method to create textual explanations about the code quality, dependent on data from software metrics. The interactive document is enriched by different kinds of visualization, including parallel coordinates plots and scatterplots for data exploration and graphics embedded into text. We devise an interaction model that allows users to explore code quality with consistent linking between text and visualizations; through integrated explanatory text, users are taught background knowledge about code quality aspects. Our approach to interactive documents was developed in a design study process that included software engineering and visual analytics experts. Although the solution is specific to the software engineering scenario, we discuss how the concept could generalize to multivariate data and report lessons learned in a broader scope.",1.0

To find the causes of air pollution, the propagation processes of air pollutants must be studied at a large spatial scale. However, the complex and dynamic wind fields lead to highly uncertain pollutant transportation. The state-of-the-art data mining approaches cannot fully support the extensive analysis of such uncertain spatiotemporal propagation processes across multiple districts without the integration of domain knowledge. The limitation of these automated approaches motivates us to design and develop AirVis, a novel visual analytics system that assists domain experts in efficiently capturing and interpreting the uncertain propagation patterns of air pollution based on graph visualizations. Designing such a system poses three challenges: a) the extraction of propagation patterns; b) the scalability of pattern presentations; and c) the analysis of propagation processes. To address these challenges, we develop a novel pattern mining framework to model pollutant transportation and extract frequent propagation patterns efficiently from large-scale atmospheric data. Furthermore, we organize the extracted patterns hierarchically based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle and empower expert users to explore and analyze these patterns effectively on the basis of pattern topologies. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach through two case studies conducted with a real-world dataset and positive feedback from domain experts.",1.0

However, the data uncertainty imposes profound challenges to fulfill advanced analytics requirements. On the one hand, many underlying data does not contain accurate geographic coordinates, e.g., positions of a mobile phone only refer to the regions (i.e., mobile cell stations) in which it resides, instead of accurate GPS coordinates. On the other hand, domain experts and general users prefer a natural way, such as using a natural language sentence, to access and analyze massive movement data. In this paper, we propose a visual analytics approach that can extract spatial-temporal constraints from a textual sentence and support an effective query method over uncertain mobile trajectory data. It is built up on encoding massive, spatially uncertain trajectories by the semantic information of the POIs and regions covered by them, and then storing the trajectory documents in text database with an effective indexing scheme. The visual interface facilitates query condition specification, situation-aware visualization, and semantic exploration of large trajectory data. Usage scenarios on real-world human mobility datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",0.0

Fully automated solutions do not reach satisfactory accuracy due to their insufficient incorporation of semantics and domain knowledge. Therefore, experts currently rely on time-consuming manual annotations. In this paper, we present a visual analytics system that augments the manual annotation process by automatically suggesting which text fragments to annotate next. The accuracy of those suggestions is improved over time by incorporating linguistic knowledge and language modeling to learn a measure of argument similarity from user interactions. Based on a long-term collaboration with domain experts, we identify and model five high-level analysis tasks. We enable close reading and note-taking, annotation of arguments, argument reconstruction, extraction of argument relations, and exploration of argument graphs. To avoid context switches, we transition between all views through seamless morphing, visually anchoring all text- and graph-based layers. We evaluate our system with a two-stage expert user study based on a corpus of presidential debates. The results show that experts prefer our system over existing solutions due to the speedup provided by the automatic suggestions and the tight integration between text and graph views.",1.0

However, in many research areas multiple, differing hierarchies need to be analyzed simultaneously in a comparative way - in particular to highlight differences between them, which sometimes can be subtle. A prominent example is the analysis of so-called phylogenetic trees in biology, reflecting hierarchical evolutionary relationships among a set of organisms. Typically, the analysis considers multiple phylogenetic trees, either to account for statistical significance or for differences in derivation of such evolutionary hierarchies; for example, based on different input data, such as the 16S ribosomal RNA and protein sequences of highly conserved enzymes. The simultaneous analysis of a collection of such trees leads to more insight into the evolutionary process. We introduce a novel visual analytics approach for the comparison of multiple hierarchies focusing on both global and local structures. A new tree comparison score has been elaborated for the identification of interesting patterns. We developed a set of linked hierarchy views showing the results of automatic tree comparison on various levels of details. This combined approach offers detailed assessment of local and global tree similarities. The approach was developed in close cooperation with experts from the evolutionary biology domain. We apply it to a phylogenetic data set on bacterial ancestry, demonstrating its application benefit.",0.0

Social media are becoming an important information input to support situational assessment (to produce awareness) in all domains. Here, we present a geovisual analytics approach to supporting SA for crisis events using one source of social media, Twitter. Specifically, we focus on leveraging explicit and implicit geographic information for tweets, on developing place-time-theme indexing schemes that support overview+detail methods and that scale analytical capabilities to relatively large tweet volumes, and on providing visual interface methods to enable understanding of place, time, and theme components of evolving situations. Our approach is user-centered, using scenario-based design methods that include formal scenarios to guide design and validate implementation as well as a systematic claims analysis to justify design choices and provide a framework for future testing. The work is informed by a structured survey of practitioners and the end product of Phase-I development is demonstrated / validated through implementation in SensePlace2, a map-based, web application initially focused on tweets but extensible to other media.",0.0

The difficulty in using EHRs for research purposes, however, is that both patient selection and record analysis must be conducted across very large, and typically very noisy datasets. Our previous work introduced EventFlow, a visualization tool that transforms an entire dataset of temporal event records into an aggregated display, allowing researchers to analyze population-level patterns and trends. As datasets become larger and more varied, however, it becomes increasingly difficult to provide a succinct, summarizing display. This paper presents a series of user-driven data simplifications that allow researchers to pare event records down to their core elements. Furthermore, we present a novel metric for measuring visual complexity, and a language for codifying disjoint strategies into an overarching simplification framework. These simplifications were used by real-world researchers to gain new and valuable insights from initially overwhelming datasets.",1.0
